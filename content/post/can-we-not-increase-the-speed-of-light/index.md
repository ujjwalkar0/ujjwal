Suppose light fall on a metal.



If energy of photon is not sufficient to remove electron from metal.

Then photon will totally reflect from metal surface with its full energy as it is elastic collision. If we supply energy on it when it reflect back then it's energy should increase. So speed of light can increase.





Like cricket. When ball fall on bat it reflected back but not go far if batsman not apply force on it.But when batsman apply force on it than we get 6 run...

**Answer** :-



As in such way you increase energy of light then it's energy will increases.

But for light

E != 1/2 mv^2

For light

E = hu

So, if E increase u also increase. That mean frequency will increase, not the speed .
