**Answer :**

Shortanswer isyou can't feel the speed of train. You feel only vibration of train. Last puja vacation while coming home i observe it clearly when my trains engine was start and both side of my train we see trains are moving in opposite direction.

I thought my train is moving. But when I looked at platform it is stop.
