### Problem Statement

Its's often happen that in unknown place people are not known about doctors,hospitals,ambulances. And also it also seen that in a hospital when patient go then their beds are not available, doctor of that diseases not available. In this time of nobel corona it is important for people to know that which Hospital can help him which not. Sometimes patient can not contact ambulance. For some bedrest person nurses are required. But we can't find it.

It will help the user to connect to doctor if he/she has some physical health problems.List of nearby Hospitals, Doctor, Ambulances will shown. If doctor feels, after seeing problems, that if he can give medicine then he can send medicine names ,or if he feels the patient must be admitted or comes to doctor , then he this messages to the patient. The hospital which are willing to take the patient will send to the patient
